# 1. DevOps

### 1.1. What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a software development methodology that combines software development (**Dev**) with information technology operations (**Ops**) participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support.

![DevOps Concepts](./docs/images/devops_concepts.png)

### 1.2. The goals of DevOps

* Fast Development Methodologies
* Fast Quality Assurance Methodologies
* Fast Deployment Methodologies
* Faster time to market
* Iteration & Continuous Feedback (strong and continuous communication between stakeholders – the end users and customers, product owners, development, quality assurance, and production engineers)

### 1.3. The benefits of DevOps

* **Environment Stabilization**

  *Enforces consistency, increase up-time*
* **Shorter Development Cycle**

  *Manage requirements and code-repository*
* **Increased Release Velocity**

  *Continuous build, push-button deployments*
* **Reduced Defects**

  *Regiment processes, automated testing*
* **Process Metrics**

  *Track both time at each stage, and the errors and exceptions*

### 1.4. The steps of DevOps

* **Plan**: task management, schedules
* **Code**: code development and code review, source code management tools, code merging
* **Build**: continuous integration tools, version control tools, build status
* **Test**: continuous testing tools that provide feedback on business risks, determine performance
* **Package**: artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging
* **Release**: change management, release approvals, release automation
* **Operate**: infrastructure installation, infrastructure changes (scalability), infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools, capacity planning, capacity & resource management, security check, service deployment, high availability (HA), data recovery, log/backup management, database management
* **Monitor**: service performance monitoring, log monitoring, end user experience, incident management

## 3. Big Data
### 3.1. What is Big Data?
A collection of **LARGE Datasets**, so it can **NOT be Processed** by traditional methods…

### 3.5. How Does Big Data Analysis Work?
![Distributed Computation](./docs/images/bigdata_analysis_overview.png)

### 3.6. Why Messing?
* Data usually flows from one application to another. It is produced by one application and used by one or more other applications. 
* Generally, the application **generating** or **sending** data is referred to as a **producer**, and the one **receiving** data is called a **consumer**.
* A simple way to send data from one application to another is to connect them to each other directly. However, tight coupling between producers and consumers requires them to be run at the same time or to implement a complex buffering mechanism. Therefore, **direct connections between producers and consumers does not scale**.

![Message Broker](./docs/images/message_broker.png)

**[Source]**: Apache Kafka

A **flexible** and **scalable** solution is to use a **message broker** or **messaging system**. Instead of applications connecting directly to each other, they connect to a message broker or a messaging system. This architecture makes it easy to add producers or consumers to a data pipeline.

### 3.7. Batch Processing vs Stream Processing
* **Batch Processing**\
  In batch processing, newly arriving data elements are collected into a group. The whole group is then processed at a future time (as a batch, hence the term “batch processing”). Exactly when each group is processed can be determined in a number of ways–for example, it can be based on a scheduled time interval (**e.g.** every five minutes, process whatever new data has been collected) or on some triggered condition (e.g. process the group as soon as it contains five data elements or as soon as it has more than 1MB of data).

  ![Batch Processing](./docs/images/batch_processing.png)

  **Micro-Batch** is frequently used to describe scenarios where batches are small and/or processed at small intervals. Even though processing may happen as often as once every few minutes, data is still processed a batch at a time.

* **Stream Processing**\
  In stream processing, each new piece of data is processed when it arrives. Unlike batch processing, there is no waiting until the next batch processing interval and data is processed as individual pieces rather than being processed a batch at a time.

  ![Stream Processing](./docs/images/streaming_processing.png)

**Use cases:**
* Algorithmic Trading, Stock Market Surveillance
* Monitoring a production line
* Intrusion, Surveillance and Fraud Detection ( e.g. Uber)
* Predictive Maintenance, (e.g. Machine Learning Techniques for Predictive Maintenance)


**Batch Processing vs Streaming Processing**

| | Batch Processing | Stream Processing |
|-|-|-|
| **Data Scope** | Queries or processing over all or most of the data in the dataset | Queries or processing over data within a rolling time window, or on just the most recent data record |
| **Data Size** | Large batches of data | Individual records or micro batches consisting of a few records |
| **Performance** | Latencies in minutes to hours | Requires latency in the order of seconds or milliseconds |
| **Analyses** | Complex analytics | Simple response functions, aggregates, and rolling metrics |
